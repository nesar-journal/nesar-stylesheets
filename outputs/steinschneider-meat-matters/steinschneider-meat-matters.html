               <p>In 2014, a film about a rooster named Baby became a surprise hit among Tamil-speaking
                  audiences. The film, directed by A. L. Vijay and starring M. Nassar and Sara Arjun,
                  tells the story of a wealthy Ceṭṭi family who have gathered in their ancestral home
                  in Kāraikkuṭi to make an offering to a local deity. Baby (Tm. Pāppā) is both the intended
                  sacrificial victim whose ritual killing promises to eliminate the family’s troubles
                  and an object of affection for the young Tamiḻcelvi (Arjun), granddaughter of the
                  family’s patriarch (Nassar). Through her endearing devotion to the bird, Tamiḻcelvi
                  manages by the final scene not only to save Baby’s life but also to convince her relatives
                  to stop eating meat altogether. Despite its pro-vegetarian message, which in contemporary
                  Tamil society can, in certain contexts, be perceived as an endorsement of Brahminical
                  elitism, the film was a critical and commercial success: at least one leading filmmaker
                  reportedly gave up meat after watching it, and a Telugu remake came out the following
                  year.<sup><a href="#ftn1" id="ret-ftn1">1</a></sup></p>

               <p>No less striking, at least from the perspective of the history of religions, is the
                  film’s title, <i>Caivam</i>, which derives from a calque on the Sanskrit <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">śaiva</span>, literally, “relating to the deity Śiva.” In colloquial Tamil, however, this term
                  does not first and foremost signify any explicitly religious belief, sentiment, social
                  practice, or institution; its primary referent is lacto-vegetarian food. Countless
                  restaurant signboards across Tamil Nadu, for instance, advertise their establishments’
                  expertise in preparing <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">caiva</span> (“vegetarian”) or <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">acaiva</span> (“non-vegetarian”) cuisine. Hence an adequate translation of the film’s title is
                  simply <em>Vegetarianism</em>. The film’s moral is consistent with this secularized sense of <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">caivam</span>, as the family abandons their entrenched dietary habits not as a result of having
                  received religious teachings, but rather because of the sheer magnetism of Tamiḻcelvi’s
                  childlike ability to love without drawing distinctions between species.</p>

               <p>Yet when and how did Tamil Śaiva religion come to be identified with vegetarianism

                  come to be perceived as anathema to established Tamil Śaiva values? And what is the
                  connection between such an understanding and the predominantly nonreligious meaning

               <p>Indologists have long realized that vegetarianism in India has a history (e.g., <a href="#Alsdorf2010">Alsdorf 2010 [1962]</a>). At least partly in response to the recent political weaponization of diet by Hindu
                  nationalists and related instances of anti-Muslim violence (<a href="#GhassemFachandi2012">Ghassem-Fachandi 2012</a>), both textual scholars and anthropologists have stressed the context-sensitivity
                  and historical contingency of South Asian vegetarian discourse, from ancient Brahminical
                  hand-wringing over Vedic animal sacrifice to modern controversies surrounding cow
                  slaughter (e.g., <a href="#Bryant2006">Bryant 2006</a>; <a href="#Doniger2009">Doniger 2009</a>; <a href="#Staples2020">Staples 2020</a>). It is now widely supposed that the identification of “Hindu” dietary practice with
                  the avoidance of meat is in no small measure a product of the gendered ideologies
                  of the colonial encounter, according to which vegetarian Hindus were often stereotyped
                  as weak and effeminate (<a href="#Nandy1983">Nandy 1983</a>). As one scholar has aptly put it, “[t]hough it is commonplace to regard Hindus as
                  vegetarian and India as the land of vegetarianism from time immemorial, historical
                  scholarship and social fact call these axioms into question; the very meaning of vegetarianism
                  has been, and continues to be, a matter of contestation and of historical and regional
                  variation” (<a href="#Roy2015">Roy 2015</a>: 272).</p>

               <p>Nevertheless, much remains unknown about what vegetarianism actually meant to specific
                  religious communities that flourished on the subcontinent during the roughly two-millennia
                  interval between Manu and Gandhi.<sup><a href="#ftn2" id="ret-ftn2">2</a></sup> This is especially so for Śaiva traditions, which are less commonly associated with
                  dietary nonviolence than their Vaiṣṇava cousins. In order to adequately resist hegemonic
                  and exclusivist representations of Indian food culture as vegetarian, it is essential
                  to address the historical, regional, and sectarian specificity of South Asian attitudes
                  toward the eating of animal flesh.<sup><a href="#ftn3" id="ret-ftn3">3</a></sup> The present article endeavors to contribute toward this goal by developing a historically
                  nuanced perspective on representations of vegetarianism in Tamil Śaiva literature
                  through a hermeneutically responsible interrogation of available textual materials.<sup><a href="#ftn4" id="ret-ftn4">4</a></sup></p>

                        I raise is rather simple: is there a single food ideology which can be termed ‘Hindu’
                        and which remains constant across time, regions, and sects…? The answer is clearly

                        before a certain point in time. What people actually ate, or eat, is of comparatively
                        little concern to the arguments elaborated here. </p>

               <p>In what follows, I argue that while Tamil Śaiva literature has long articulated the
                  normativity of vegetarianism, it would have been, if not impossible, at least relatively
                  rare to find the fact of being a Śaiva conceptually equated with the maintenance of
                  an exclusively plant-based diet prior to the second half of the sixteenth century.
                  In fact, the earliest explicit attempt to differentiate between Śaiva and non-Śaiva
                  diets in the manner of the modern Tamil antonyms <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">caivam</span>/<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">acaivam</span> likely dates to roughly a century later. I further suggest that at least one factor
                  that contributed to the drawing of this distinction was the emergence of new notions
                  of “self” and “other” in this period and a corresponding need to rethink the contour
                  and configuration of community boundaries. Facing new social contexts marked by considerable
                  status mobility and intense religious competition, seventeenth-century Tamil Śaiva
                  intellectuals consciously adapted existing forms of vegetarian rhetoric in ways that
                  anticipated discourse about food in modern Tamil. </p>

               <p>An important piece of evidence for this transformation is a brief polemic against
                  animal slaughter entitled <i>Kolaimaṟuttal</i> (hereafter, <i>Rejecting Killing</i>). Probably composed during the late seventeenth century in the vicinity of present-day
                  Coimbatore, in the traditional Tamil region known as Koṅkunāṭu, the text appears to
                  be, with perhaps a single exception, the first independent composition in the Tamil
                  language dedicated to promoting vegetarianism. While admittedly not widely known today,
                  there are reasons to believe that the text played a significant role in making vegetarianism
                  a central feature of Tamil Śaiva identity. It received a lengthy commentary, probably
                  during its author’s lifetime, and thereafter seems to have circulated widely, particularly
                  in the Koṅkunāṭu region.<sup><a href="#ftn5" id="ret-ftn5">5</a></sup> The influential colonial-era Śaiva reformer Āṟumuka Nāvalar (1822–1879) published
                  the text in 1860 (<a href="#Hudson1992">Hudson 1992</a>: 42), and it is likely that the text also served as a key inspiration for the Śaiva
                  mystical poet Irāmaliṅka Aṭikaḷ’s (1823–1874) concept of “compassion for living beings”

                  it to be an innovative attempt to navigate conditions then prevalent in the Tamil-speaking

                  a novel alimentary ideology, referred to in this article as “Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em>,” according to which nonviolence, conceived primarily in terms of vegetarian dietary
                  practices, is represented as the quintessential Śaiva virtue and the principal basis

               <p>Accounting for Campantar’s relative silence on the subject, <a href="#Ulrich2007">Ulrich</a> (249) points to the poet’s “support for Vedic sacrifice” and “valorization of meat
                  eating in a devotional context.” The latter refers to celebrated instances in the
                  lives of certain Tamil Śaiva saints, such as the hunter Kaṇṇappar, whose hagiography
                  is elaborated in the twelfth-century <i>Periyapurāṇam</i>. While Kaṇṇappar’s life story assumes the transgressiveness of meat (the saint famously
                  offered Śiva a freshly slaughtered boar, to the horror of a Brahmin onlooker), it
                  subordinates dietary norms to devotional intensity (<a href="#Ulrich2007"><em>ibid</em>.</a>; <a href="#Cox2005">Cox 2005</a>: 235–236) and the power of austerities performed in previous lives (<a href="#Monius2004">Monius 2004</a>: 156).

                  century.<sup><a href="#ftn8" id="ret-ftn8">8</a></sup> This text’s initial volume, which celebrates Śiva’s divine instruction and outlines
                  qualifications for entering the path to liberation (<a href="#Martin1983">Martin 1983</a>: 120), contains two adjacent pairs of quatrains under the headings “Not killing”
                  (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">kollāmai</span>, vv. 197–198) and “Rejecting meat” (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">pulāṉmaṟuttal</span>, vv. 199–200).<sup><a href="#ftn9" id="ret-ftn9">9</a></sup> It should be noted that these same topical headings also occur as the titles for
                  two decads in the much earlier <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i> (circa 500 CE), a renowned collection of 1,330 aphorisms on the moral life. These
                  very decads have, in fact, been cited as evidence for the <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i>’s likely Jaina authorship (<a href="#Zvelebil1973">Zvelebil 1973</a>: 157), though every Tamil-speaking religious community has claimed the <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i> as its own. Whatever relationship, if any, the <i>Tirumantiram</i>’s first volume may bear to the <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i>, it is important to recognize that the former interprets abstention from violence
                  and meat within a decidedly Śaiva theological framework.<sup><a href="#ftn10" id="ret-ftn10">10</a></sup> Thus, v. 197 associates the practice of nonkilling with the worship of one’s guru,
                  and v. 200 suggests that those who have attained Śiva’s feet do not kill or commit
                  other sins. Sandwiched between these are two conceptually similar stanzas, the second
                  of which is possibly the earliest explicit condemnation of nonvegetarianism in Tamil
                  Śaiva literature:</p>

               <p>Later Śaiva authors repeatedly returned to the themes iterated in this quatrain, which
                  links meat eaters with lowly birth and vividly depicts the terrible fate awaiting
                  them after death. In context, v. 199 can be interpreted to suggest that maintaining
                  a vegetarian diet is necessary in order to be eligible for receiving Śiva’s liberating
                  grace and avoiding an unpleasant rebirth. While this is clearly distinct from the
                  stance adopted in the <i>Tēvāram</i>, dietary nonviolence is hardly portrayed as the archetypal Śaiva virtue in the <i>Tirumantiram</i>. Rather, it is accorded roughly the same importance as a host of other good qualities
                  mentioned in the first volume, including equanimity, devotion, generosity, sexual
                  continence, and abstention from alcohol.</p>

               <p>Expressions of the evils of eating meat become noticeably more common during the late
                  sixteenth century. Two Tamil texts from this period are particularly rich sources
                  for such statements. The first is the <i>Kācikaṇṭam</i>, an adaptation of the <i>Kāśīkhaṇḍa</i> on Benares, which became widely distributed in South India shortly after its circa
                  mid-fourteenth-century composition (<a href="#Minkowski2002">Minkowski 2002</a>: 331–332). The second is the <i>Civatarumōttaram</i>, an influential translation of the circa sixth–seventh-century <i>Śivadharmottara</i> on lay Śaiva praxis.<sup><a href="#ftn12" id="ret-ftn12">12</a></sup> Both texts denounce killing and consuming animals in the context of delineating forms
                  of behavior (in)appropriate for uninitiated Śaiva householders. While the precise
                  relationship between these works and their respective Sanskrit source materials awaits
                  further study, for now it can be said that the <i>Kācikaṇṭam</i> and <i>Civatarumōttaram</i> supported, as proof texts, the development of a ritual-prescriptive framework for
                  theorizing and policing the dietary practices of lay Śaivas in South India.<sup><a href="#ftn13" id="ret-ftn13">13</a></sup></p>

               <p>Lines 3–8 adapt the fire and brimstone message of <i>Tirumantiram</i> v. 199 (presumably the cited “treatise”), dilating graphically upon the tortures
                  awaiting nonvegetarians in hell. The initial two lines, however, are reminiscent of
                  the Kannada Vīraśaiva <em>vacana</em> corpus—notionally dating to the twelfth century but in any case available to intellectuals
                  in the sixteenth (see <a href="#ChandraShobhi2005">Chandra Shobhi 2005</a> and Ben-Herut this issue)—a central theme of which is the notion that the body constitutes
                  the true Śiva temple.<sup><a href="#ftn16" id="ret-ftn16">16</a></sup> Striking for their uncompromising universalism, these two lines have entered the
                  proverbial repertoire of learned Tamil speakers, though their origins are largely
                  forgotten (<a href="#Arunacalam2005">Aruṇācalam 2005 [1975]</a>: 273–274). Taken as a whole, this verse expands the theological significance of vegetarianism
                  by associating the condemnation of meat eaters with a reflection on the very nature
                  of living beings and their embodied forms. If all bodies are Śiva temples, then to
                  be vegetarian is to actively care for the deity’s sacred abode and the divine presence
                  that dwells within it, while to be otherwise is to desecrate the same. Moreover, by
                  foregrounding this idea at the beginning of its exposition of Śiva-gnosis, the text
                  implies that vegetarianism is not simply one of the virtues a Śaiva must cultivate
                  but rather the very sine qua non of liberation.</p>

                  a temple town located on the western edge of present-day Coimbatore, and text-internal
                  evidence supports the hypothesis that <i>Rejecting Killing</i> is a product of the early modern Tamil hinterlands.<sup><a href="#ftn17" id="ret-ftn17">17</a></sup> The text received a single, lengthy commentary, also anonymous, which is traditionally

                  information traditionally provided at the beginning of a Tamil scholastic treatise,
                  hints at the work’s hybrid form while still managing to appear entirely conventional.
                  <i>Kolaimaṟuttal</i> is a kind of portmanteau of “Not killing” (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">kollāmai</span>) and “Rejecting meat” (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">pulāṉmaṟuttal</span>), recalling, of course, the aforementioned passages of the <i>Tirumantiram</i> and <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i>. However, the verb <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">maṟuttal</span>, according to the University of Madras <i>Tamil Lexicon</i> (s.v.), can also mean “to confute, refute the opinion or argument of another,” suggesting
                  the text’s concern to counter other religious traditions’ justifications for animal
                  slaughter. This innovative blending of dietary didacticism with formal religious polemics
                  in the guise of a profound traditionalism is crucial to the text’s social agenda,

                        cites from another text entitled <i>Pulāṉmaṟuttal</i> (<i>Rejecting Meat</i>, not to be confused with the identically named chapter of the <i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i>), about which I have unfortunately failed to uncover any relevant information.</p>

               <p>Among those assembled at this seventeenth-century South Indian World’s Parliament
                  of Religions are representatives from the “outer religions” or <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">puṟa-c camayaṅkaḷ</span>. This is a technical term used in Tamil Śaiva Siddhānta polemics to differentiate
                  between traditions that do not acknowledge the authoritativeness of Vedic and Śaiva
                  Āgamic revelation and the “inner religions” (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">aka-c camayaṅkaḷ</span>) that do. The <em>locus classicus</em> for this distinction is the circa thirteenth-century philosophical treatise <i>Civañāṉacittiyār</i>, a text that is partially structured as a systematic refutation of fourteen rival
                  schools (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">parapakkam</span>), and partially as an elaboration of the established doctrine (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">cupakkam</span>). Of note here is the way in which <i>Rejecting Killing</i> subtly begins to refocus the meaning of heteropraxy around a rejection of what is
                  perceived to be the settled position of divine revelation on matters of dietary practice.
                  Following, for the most part, the twofold pattern established in the <i>Civañāṉacittiyār</i>, the Śaiva will illuminate the nature of alimentary orthopraxy by rebutting the claims
                  of his opponents and expounding the conclusion accepted by the tradition.<sup><a href="#ftn20" id="ret-ftn20">20</a></sup></p>

                     <p><a href="#ftn20">20</a><i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s polemical form is likely inspired by a brief reference to Buddhist nonvegetarianism
                        in the <i>Civañāṉacittiyār</i>. In the latter’s rebuttal of Sautrāntika Buddhism, the text makes the opponent claim
                        that while killing is unacceptable (it had been celebrated by the previous opponent,
                        the Materialist, at <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">parapakkam</span> v. 36, <a href="#Balasubramanian2013">Balasubramanian 2013</a>: 130–131), eating creatures killed by another is not, since what is dead is insentient
                        and since the demerit of killing accrues only to the killer, not the eater (v. 92,
                        178). The text responds, from the perspective of the accepted position, by placing
                        responsibility for the sin that accrues to the butcher squarely on the Buddhist, since
                        it is for the latter’s sake that animals are killed. The opponent is then portrayed
                        as a hypocrite thrice over: accumulating sins for one who feeds him, he lacks austerity;
                        he eats meat but does not offer the same to his deity; and he is disgusted by his
                        own bodily impurity but not that of the creatures he eats (v. 131, 220–221). As in
                        Campantar’s dietary polemics, it is not meat-eating per se, but rather the Buddhist’s
                        purported deficiency of austerity, as well as his ritual inconsistency, that is singled
                        out for ridicule. Nonetheless, the explicit reference to another tradition’s support
                        for nonvegetarianism in a formal <em>pūrvapakṣa</em>/<em>siddhānta</em> context can be understood to have anticipated the approach adopted in <i>Rejecting Killing</i>.</p>

               <p>Also present are common folk (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">ulakar</span>, lit. “worldly people”) whose religious identity is unmarked. Presumably the anonymous
                  man (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">oruvaṉ</span>) in v. 2, who serves as the text-internal witness to the imminent public exchange,
                  also belongs to this group. Indeed, the conceit of the assembly (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">avai</span>, Skt. <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">sabhā</span>) appears designed to draw attention to this questioner. One could conceive of a hypothetical
                  scenario in which the text omitted v. 2 and proceeded directly to elaborating and
                  defending its core position; what would be lost is precisely this spectator, whose
                  implied conversion to vegetarianism toward the end of the text constitutes a kind
                  of narrative climax. This suggests that the common folk are closely linked to the
                  text’s intended audience. The latter are identified in v. 1, which proclaims that
                  <i>Rejecting Killing</i> was composed “so that those who fear the fire [of hell] will reject killing and attain
                  virtue” (<span><span class="scriptWrapper" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn" data-nesar-original="añciṉar tīkk’ aṟaṅ kolaimai taḷḷi-c cārtaṟk’">añciṉar tīkk’ aṟaṅ kolaimai taḷḷi-c cārtaṟk’</span></span>). Thus, the text can be said to imagine an audience of nonvegetarians, unaffiliated
                  to any specific religious tradition, who nevertheless are at least potentially receptive
                  to the authority of revealed Śaiva scriptures on the matter of correct dietary discipline.

                  a response to a question concerning the relative rank of “the many forms living beings
                  assume in this world” (<span><span class="scriptWrapper" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn" data-nesar-original="īṇṭ’ aṭutta pala-v uyir-t tōṟṟatt’">īṇṭ’ aṭutta pala-v uyir-t tōṟṟatt’</span></span>). In its primary sense, the phrase <span><span class="scriptWrapper" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn" data-nesar-original="uyir-t tōṟṟam">uyir-t tōṟṟam</span></span>, literally “appearance of living beings,” refers to a common taxonomy according to
                  which creatures are grouped on the basis of their mode of generation, namely, egg-born
                  (Skt. <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">aṇḍaja</span>), moisture-born (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">svedaja</span>), sprout-born (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">udbhijja</span>), and womb-born (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">jarāyuja</span>). Both this fourfold system (Skt. <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">bhūtagrāma</span>) and the twofold division of beings into “immobile” and “mobile” categories are found
                  at the beginning of the ancient Ayurvedic treatise <i>Suśrutasaṁhitā</i>, though they also appear in other contexts, notably the epics and <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">dharmaśāstra</span>, where they are often linked to the process of the Self’s transmigration through
                  different forms of embodied being (<a href="#Zimmerman1987">Zimmerman 1987</a>: 199). The concept was appropriated within specific soteriological traditions, and
                  frequently recurs in contexts emphasizing the rarity of human birth and the need to
                  use one’s time to pursue liberation. For instance, the <i>Civañāṉacittiyār</i> (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">cupakkam</span>, vv. 179–181) refers to the <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">uyir-t tōṟṟam</span> while explicating the process by which Śiva causes the soul to pass through an elaborate
                  series of embodiments across hundreds of thousands of lifetimes, culminating in one’s
                  birth as a man in a middle-class Śaiva family in India. The distinction between vegetarian
                  and nonvegetarian humans also came to be folded into such accounts of the transmigratory
                  process, likely not much prior to <i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s composition. Thus, the circa fifteenth-century religious anthology <i>Peruntiraṭṭu</i> (1912, <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">arumaiyuraittal</span>, v. 6, 30), charting the path of the Self to the highest form of embodiment (namely,
                  a Brahmin male in the Cōḻa country who understands the Vedānta), stresses the rare
                  good fortune of not being born among meat eaters in the hill country.</p>

                  seek to sustain their bodies with those of other beings (<i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i> v. 329, v. 251); and (2) that the wise realize that killing leads to unfortunate
                  rebirths and are aware of the impermanence of the body, which is not worthy of nourishing
                  at the cost of others’ lives, and who therefore would rather forfeit their life than
                  take another’s (<i>Tirukkuṟaḷ</i> v. 255, v. 325, v. 330, v. 338, v. 340, v. 327). Fusing taxonomy with ethical insight,
                  the Śaiva thus presents vegetarians as the pinnacle of embodied existence. </p>

                  that is nevertheless presented as originating from a Śaiva source. This framing of
                  Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em> as a universal value constitutes, I would suggest, a new understanding of vegetarianism
                  in Tamil Śaiva thought, one that views it as pertinent not only to brahmins, monastics,
                  ascetics, or even lay Śaiva householders, but rather, like A. L. Vijay’s <i>Caivam</i>, to all people. In the conclusion, I will link this formulation to what I see as
                  the text’s attempt at establishing a meatless public in the frontier region of late
                  seventeenth-century Koṅkunāṭu.</p>

               <p>Nevertheless, the bulk of <i>Rejecting Killing</i> defends the vegetarian’s superiority on decidedly religious grounds, above all by
                  countering objections raised by representatives of the “outer religions.” A stylistic
                  peculiarity of the text, however, is that the identity of these interlocutors and
                  their counterarguments are not, for the most part, made explicit. More specifically,
                  although the text maintains the situation of oral interreligious debate through periodic
                  usage of the grammatical second person (e.g., “your words are mistaken,” <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">uṉ coṟ piḻai-y ām</span>, v. 6), it tends to relate only the established conclusion (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">uttarapakṣa</span>/<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">siddhānta</span>), omitting most of the various opponents’ prima facie positions (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">pūrvapakṣa</span>). While the basic gist of the text is often clear enough, an adequate understanding
                  is frequently impossible without the aid of a commentary, which must supply the unstated

                  nonvegetarian audience, such as literate members of a rural peasantry. It is possible
                  that Cāntaliṅka himself would have provided the original, oral exegesis of the text.
                  However, his hagiography suggests that he commissioned the learned scholar Tiruppōrūr
                  Citampara Cuvāmikaḷ, his disciple’s student, to compose commentaries for <i>Rejecting Killing</i> and other works, implying that he intended the text to be read in conjunction with
                  Citampara Cuvāmikaḷ’s written commentary. The ensuing discussion inevitably makes

               <p>The polemic thus advances in a logical sequence, its target moving (sometimes mid-verse)
                  from the extreme claim that killing is intrinsically permissible to a series of progressively
                  more qualified stances that accept killing in specific contexts, or that reject killing
                  as such but permit the consumption of animal flesh under certain conditions. The text
                  thus reveals the truth gradually, which makes sense given its didactic aims.<sup><a href="#ftn24" id="ret-ftn24">24</a></sup> Conspicuously absent from the list of interlocutors are the Jains. Presumably this
                  is because they are known to reject nonvegetarianism in all circumstances, unlike
                  Tamil Śaivas, who, as noted, traditionally recognize its legitimacy within certain
                  Vedic sacrificial and devotional contexts. The Jains, therefore, would according to
                  the text’s internal logic have to be positioned “higher” in the hierarchy than the
                  Śaiva, which is clearly unacceptable. Of the interlocutors who <em>are</em> listed in <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, numbers 2, 3, and 5 constitute relatively new quarries for Tamil Śaiva polemicists.

                  explores their relevance for the formation of Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em>.</p>

                  communities, de Nobili (in)famously fashioned himself after the manner of a Brahmin
                  ascetic and wrote Tamil in a style calibrated to engage learned audiences, especially
                  Śaivas.<sup><a href="#ftn29" id="ret-ftn29">29</a></sup> Although his criticisms of rebirth are, like those of other contemporary Jesuits,
                  framed in strictly philosophical terms (<a href="#Clooney2014">Clooney 2014</a>), in certain of his writings they occur in the context of discussions that allude
                  to biblical accounts of humanity’s God-given dominion over the animals and the latter’s
                  rebellion that was precipitated by the Fall. This is the case, for instance, in de

               <p>The paraphrased verses of the <i>Ēcumatanirākaraṇam</i> can thus be understood as an attempt to undermine Jesuit arguments against rebirth
                  by demonstrating the incoherence of this larger “creation and sin narrative” within
                  which they are sometimes set. Strictly speaking, they are not focused on meat eating,
                  but rather on the problems certain animals and animal behaviors pose for the theory
                  of humankind’s dominion over the animal world. However, by situating these arguments
                  within a text dedicated to refuting nonvegetarianism, Cāntaliṅka implicitly draws
                  a link between perceived inconsistencies in Christian doctrine and impure Christian
                  dietary practices. S<sub>5</sub> makes this connection clear, cleverly tying its affirmation of rebirth to <i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s central thesis, namely, the supremacy of vegetarian humans in the transmigratory

                        5, 2020). It is well known that De Nobili renounced meat to more effectively proselytize
                        the higher castes. However, the existence of anti-vegetarian propaganda in the seventeenth
                        century cannot be ruled out. A prominent class of missionaries, the <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">paṇṭāracuvāmi</span>s, were not strictly vegetarian. Historical precedent also existed in the medieval

                  in the restricted context of Vedic sacrifice is theoretically acceptable because it
                  enjoined by the Vedas, which are the utterances of the lord. (3) Nevertheless, no
                  similar authoritative scripture exists for the performance of extra-Vedic animal sacrifice,
                  which is consequently to be shunned (vv. 12–14). (4) Left-handed tantric rituals may

                  follow the path of the Vedas and the Āgamas (vv. 14–15). (5) The wise burn up their
                  karma by refusing to kill and as a result eat the ambrosia that is liberation (v.

               <p>The most striking aspect of this lengthy section of the text is the attention given
                  to clarifying the theoretical, scriptural, and moral underpinnings of ritual praxis.
                  The Śaiva feels the need to carefully distinguish between divine and demonic sacrificial
                  recipients, rites that are rooted in divine revelation and those that are not, the
                  superior and inferior results of different kinds of rituals and, finally, the nature
                  of those whose lives are organized around alternately nonviolent and violent forms
                  of ritual behavior. The anxiety evident in this discussion is likely indicative of
                  the fact that the Vāmi, among all the text’s implied interlocutors, is arguably the
                  one whose established ritual regimen most closely resembles that of <i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s protagonist. His presence, therefore, threatens to dissolve the boundary between
                  the Śaiva community the text wishes to imagine into being and those whom it seeks
                  to place outside of it.</p>

                  target of earlier Tamil Śaiva polemics.<sup><a href="#ftn35" id="ret-ftn35">35</a></sup> It seems reasonable, therefore, to ask whom <i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s author might have in mind. Though admittedly speculative, a plausible answer can
                  be found in the wealth of roughly contemporaneous Tamil <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">cittar</span> literature, a regional development of the pan-Indic <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">siddha</span> traditions of the second millennium. Among the vast and heterogeneous <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">cittar</span> corpus is a prolific genre attributed by <a href="#Venkatraman1990">Venkatraman</a> (<a href="#Venkatraman1990">1990</a>: 7) to a group of authors known as “Kāyasiddhas.” According to <a href="#Weiss2009">Weiss</a> (<a href="#Weiss2009">2009</a>: 48), these Kāyasiddha texts deal with “Tamil traditions of knowledge such as alchemy,
                  medicine, astrology, yoga, and tantric ritual,” and “detail ways in which ordinary
                  people can obtain [supernatural powers and eternal youth] through yoga, mantras, or
                  mineral compounds.” Though generally Śaiva in orientation, this literature concentrates
                  on the worship of Bālā/Tripurasundarī and a host of other local goddesses, often endorsing
                  the use of transgressive substances associated with left-handed tantric praxis (<a href="#Venkatraman1990">Venkatraman 1990</a>: 9, 94–96). One author, Koṅkaṇar, is particularly intriguing. In addition to the
                  fact that he apparently lived in Koṅkunāṭu (as his name suggests) during the late
                  seventeenth century, he explicitly identifies himself as a Vāmi in at least one of
                  the texts bearing his name (<a href="#Venkatraman1990"><em>ibid</em>.</a>, 54, 95 n. 50). So great was his reputation in this region, moreover, that he is
                  mentioned in non-<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">cittar</span> texts from the following century, including the <i>Koṅkumaṇṭalacatakam</i> as well as two narrative compositions that seek to subordinate his considerable power
                  to that of Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva saints, respectively (<a href="#Venkatraman1990"><em>ibid</em>.</a>, 55–56, nn. 45–46). While dating the Kāyasiddha literature remains a problem (<a href="#Weiss2009">Weiss 2009</a>: 49), there is little reason to doubt that Koṅkunāṭu was a hotbed of Kāyasiddha activity
                  at the time of <i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s composition.<sup><a href="#ftn36" id="ret-ftn36">36</a></sup></p>

                  (vv. 16–17), and then proceeds to refute claims associated in the commentary with
                  several different “common folk” (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">laukikar</span>). Some of the Śaiva’s points here are standard <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">dharmaśāstra</span> fare, for example his suggestion that eating flesh in medicinal contexts, to save
                  someone’s life, or during <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">śrāddha</span> rites is not permissible in the current degenerate age (v. 17). Others appeal to
                  a kind of common sense, particularly appropriate for these lay interlocutors. For
                  instance, to the implicit objection that flesh is needed to nourish a body made of
                  flesh, the Śaiva’s response is that, on the same logic, one should be prepared to
                  consume excrement (v. 18). The discussion culminates in the remarkable nineteenth
                  verse, which the commentary suggests counters a series of claims, the first of which
                  is that persons belonging to nonvegetarian castes must continue to eat meat:</p>

                  animals are the only natural meat eaters and alludes to several Purāṇic narratives
                  of carnivorous animals who, despite their nature, found it in themselves to forgo
                  flesh (S<sub>1</sub>–S<sub>2</sub>). S<sub>3</sub>–S<sub>5</sub> then address several implied counterarguments: that one must do as one parents did;
                  that even if it is advisable to renounce meat from birth, there is no point in doing

                  will of one’s inmost being, one should abandon the project. The text thus advocates
                  rejecting both family and caste nonvegetarianism to construct a reformed community
                  of vegetarians. In a sense, this is the position that the text was building to throughout
                  the entire polemical exchange, the entire point of which, as we have seen, was to
                  clarify the superiority of vegetarians within the transmigratory schema for the edification
                  of the layman mentioned in v. 2. Having dispensed with all religious and worldly objections,
                  the text culminates in the claim that those who understand the truth must fearlessly
                  abandon the meat-eating practices of their parents and community and lead a pure vegetarian

               <p>The radical implications of this position are fleshed out in the final three verses,

                  doubts of the man from v. 2, who has now decided to henceforth renounce killing animals
                  and eating their meat. Stanzas 20–21 stress that even if one has adopted the vow of
                  nonkilling (<span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">kollā noṉpu</span>), one will still go to hell if one’s wife, children, and kinfolk eat meat because

                  Verse 22 adds a final qualification that one should also avoid certain flesh-like
                  plants and warns against backsliding into nonvegetarianism and a life dedicated to
                  the body. It closes by emphasizing the need to join a community possessed of true

            <div class="text-paragraph">
               <p>Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em> may be profitably interpreted as a form of “frontier Śaivism.” In proposing this
                  phrase, I have in mind recent studies of Jews and Mormons in the late nineteenth-century
                  United States (<a href="#Rabin2017">Rabin 2017</a>; <a href="#SmithHansen2019">Smith Hansen 2019</a>) and goddess cults in southwestern China (<a href="#Bryson2017">Bryson 2017</a>) that call attention to the ways in which religious traditions evolve on the real
                  and imagined boundaries of established socio-moral orders. It has already been mentioned
                  that <i>Rejecting Killing</i> was probably composed in the Tamil uphill region, perhaps in Pērūr. This area was
                  hardly central to the traditional Tamil Śaiva geographic imagination if we take as
                  our guide temples celebrated by the poets of the <i>Tēvāram</i>. During the late seventeenth century, Pērūr would likely have been a small town (as
                  it is today) focused around its main temple, dedicated to Śiva Paṭṭīcuvarar. The status
                  of different local caste groups, such as the Kavuṇṭars or Koṅku Vēḷḷāḷar, were still
                  relatively fluid, with the coming division between so-called “right” and “left” castes
                  only beginning to crystallize (<a href="#Beck1972">Beck 1972</a>: 32). On the other hand, Susan <a href="#Bayly1989">Bayly</a> (<a href="#Bayly1989">1989</a>) demonstrates that the late precolonial Tamil hinterland was undergoing rapid change
                  due to increased interaction with the settled peoples of the major rice-producing
                  river valleys and the intensification of dry-zone agriculture. The local religious
                  landscape, at the time centered on the worship of blood-drinking goddesses and other
                  fierce male deities, was also in a state of flux, with the construction of new temples
                  to Śiva and Viṣṇu and the gradual expansion of Christian missionary influence in the
                  region. </p>

               <p>An underexplored aspect of this dramatic transformation is the role played by Śaiva
                  monastic institutions. Cāntaliṅka is supposed to have founded a Vīraśaiva monastery
                  in Pērūr, which still stands today. This monastery maintains ties to Tiruvāvaṭutuṟai,
                  a preeminent Śaiva Siddhānta–affiliated monastery, through Cāntaliṅka’s guru, Tuṟaiyūr
                  Civappirakāca Cuvāmikaḷ, who is remembered to have adopted Vīraśaiva orthopraxy in
                  a bid to restore Śaiva worship at Citamparam (<a href="#Koppedrayer1990">Koppedrayer 1990</a>: 206 n. 381). It may have been the case that <i>Rejecting Killing</i> was intended to reform a recently constituted group of semi-literate Koṅkunāṭu landowners
                  into a community united in its shared commitment to vegetarianism and unswerving allegiance
                  to enlightened Śaiva ritual-moral leadership based at the newly established Pērūr
                  <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">ātīṉam</span>. This would suggest that the development of Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em> is at least partly connected to the expansion of Śaiva monastic networks from their
                  base in the Kaveri Delta to the increasingly economically important uphill regions
                  during the seventeenth century. Likely also relevant is Pērūr’s geographical proximity
                  to modern-day Karnataka, a region with longstanding ties to vegetarian Vīraśaiva and
                  Digambara Jain communities.</p>

               <p>As a literary artifact from the early modern Tamil Śaiva frontier, <i>Rejecting Killing</i> can be regarded an innovative attempt at constructing a meatless, and thus implicitly
                  Śaivicized, public through persuasive argumentation. Line-drawings accompanying the
                  first edition of the text, published in 1844, capture this public dimension, depicting
                  the Śaiva, his supplicant, and the now-enlightened assembled host, gathered before
                  seated images of Cāntaliṅka Cuvāmikaḷ and Citampara Cuvāmi, with several figures holding
                  what would appear to be manuscripts of <i>Rejecting Killing</i> and Cāntaliṅka’s three other compositions in their hands (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).<sup><a href="#ftn39" id="ret-ftn39">39</a></sup> It is possible that the text’s effort to persuade lay audiences to alter the way
                  they live was at least partly inspired by contact with contemporary Christian writings
                  in Tamil.<sup><a href="#ftn40" id="ret-ftn40">40</a></sup> However, spaces for certain kinds of public religious instruction in Tamil predated

               <p>Stepping back momentarily from the immediate context, it is worth briefly considering
                  the significance of Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em> with respect to scholarship on religious foodways in other traditions. In a relatively
                  recent study, <a href="#Freidenreich2011">Freidenreich</a> (<a href="#Freidenreich2011">2011</a>) examines the ways Jewish, Christian, and Muslim legal traditions imagine community
                  boundaries through norms governing food prepared by and shared with religious others.
                  Through a careful comparison of these “foreign food restrictions,” Freidenreich shows
                  how ancient and medieval intellectuals associated with each tradition go about classifying
                  religious insiders and outsiders in qualitatively different ways. He writes, “They
                  draw incongruent border lines around their respective communities and establish different
                  kinds of barriers along these borders because they imagine the proper social order
                  in fundamentally different ways” (24). Thus, while Jews tended to <em>mark the otherness</em> of non-Jews without distinguishing among them, Christians <em>defined the otherness</em> of non-Christians as either “not Us” or “anti-Us,” and Muslims <em>relativized the otherness</em> of non-Muslims as either “like-Us” or “unlike Us” (30).</p>

               <p>Although he is uninterested in what he calls “ingredient-based religious food restrictions”
                  (21), Freidenreich is helpful for thinking about how <i>Rejecting Killing</i> might constitute a new style of “imagining otherness” within the Tamil Śaiva tradition.
                  Clearly, the idea that food, or even meat specifically, would demarcate a religious
                  boundary in South Asia is not particularly new. However, the text’s use of diet to
                  organize and comparatively evaluate religious difference constitutes a noticeable
                  departure from the concerns of earlier Tamil Śaiva Siddhānta polemics. It is well
                  known that polemical literature became a site of intense productivity and innovation
                  in the final precolonial centuries. One noteworthy development, discussed by <a href="#Fisher2017">Fisher</a> (<a href="#Fisher2017">2017</a>: 128), is the heightened concern exhibited by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
                  South Indian intellectuals with respect to issues of “public sectarian comportment,”
                  for example the propriety of bearing Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava insignia on the body. Such
                  outward signs of sectarian affiliation, she suggests, were coming to assume a new
                  role “in defining the boundaries of public space” (134) in South Indian society at
                  this time. What this article has called Caiva <em>ahiṁsā</em> seems to constitute a further ramification of the polemical genre in this general
                  direction. Here, it is not what one’s tribe puts <em>on</em> their bodies as much as what they put <em>in</em> them, and <em>in</em> those of their deities, that primarily serves to “mark the difference” in one’s public
                  religious identity. Among the factors one might point to in accounting for this enhanced
                  semantic significance of food, and meat in particular, one thinks of the centrality
                  of food-giving for expressions of Nāyaka-era kingship (<a href="#Rao1992">Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 1992</a>: 67–68), a general post-Vijayanagara Brahminization of South Indian <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="san" data-nesar-script="Latn">maṭha</span> culture (<a href="#Stoker2016">Stoker 2016</a>: 8), and a widespread tendency in early modern India to critique tantric transgressiveness

               <p>Ultimately, <i>Rejecting Killing</i> is the type of text one assigns for a class entitled “Śaivism 101.” This interest
                  in schooling others in the “basics” of Śaivism foreshadows later developments in Tamil
                  Śaiva discourse. The attention to vegetarianism, Christians, the impropriety of animal
                  sacrifice, and the reformation of a Tamil public through careful scripture-based moral
                  instruction are all hallmarks, for instance, of the titan of nineteenth-century Tamil
                  Śaivism, Āṟumuka Nāvalar, who as mentioned above published the text in the mid-nineteenth
                  century. Attempts to transform local populations into pious, Āgama-compliant Śaiva
                  vegetarians and to deny the legitimacy of meat-eating “others” by no means began with
                  the advent of European colonialism. Thus, our text, despite having fallen into relative
                  obscurity, anticipated a major strand of colonial-era religious rhetoric, while putting
                  its finger, as it were, on an issue that, as A. L. Vijay’s <i>Caivam</i> indicates, continues to be hotly debated among Tamil-speakers to this day.</p>

                  the text’s allusion to Christianity, preoccupation with Śākta blood sacrifice, and

               <p><a href="#ret-ftn20" class="jump-up">↑</a><i>Rejecting Killing</i>’s polemical form is likely inspired by a brief reference to Buddhist nonvegetarianism
                  in the <i>Civañāṉacittiyār</i>. In the latter’s rebuttal of Sautrāntika Buddhism, the text makes the opponent claim
                  that while killing is unacceptable (it had been celebrated by the previous opponent,
                  the Materialist, at <span class="foreign" data-nesar-lang="tam" data-nesar-script="Latn">parapakkam</span> v. 36, <a href="#Balasubramanian2013">Balasubramanian 2013</a>: 130–131), eating creatures killed by another is not, since what is dead is insentient
                  and since the demerit of killing accrues only to the killer, not the eater (v. 92,
                  178). The text responds, from the perspective of the accepted position, by placing
                  responsibility for the sin that accrues to the butcher squarely on the Buddhist, since
                  it is for the latter’s sake that animals are killed. The opponent is then portrayed
                  as a hypocrite thrice over: accumulating sins for one who feeds him, he lacks austerity;
                  he eats meat but does not offer the same to his deity; and he is disgusted by his
                  own bodily impurity but not that of the creatures he eats (v. 131, 220–221). As in
                  Campantar’s dietary polemics, it is not meat-eating per se, but rather the Buddhist’s
                  purported deficiency of austerity, as well as his ritual inconsistency, that is singled
                  out for ridicule. Nonetheless, the explicit reference to another tradition’s support
                  for nonvegetarianism in a formal <em>pūrvapakṣa</em>/<em>siddhānta</em> context can be understood to have anticipated the approach adopted in <i>Rejecting Killing</i>.</p>

                  twelfth-century Śaiva Siddhānta treatise <i>Tirukkaḷiṟṟuppaṭiyār</i> had declared the spectacular and sometimes violent deeds performed by Śiva’s saints
